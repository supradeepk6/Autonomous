If you're looking at this document, something has probably gone wrong with the TensorFlow build. This assumes that the script 'buildTensorFlow.sh' failed to finish properly.

This directory contains a more verbose version of buildTensorFlow.sh

$ ./buildTensorFlow.sh

This is a more verbose version of the original buildTensorFlow.sh in the parent directory. A file named 'explain.txt' is generated in the $HOME/tensorflow directory.

This should  show you where the build is failing.
